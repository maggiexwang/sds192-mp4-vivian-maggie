![Samuel L. Jackson, who is featured in all Quentin Tarantino movies but one, acts out the classic line from *Gone with the Wind*.](https://media.giphy.com/media/J0nrGGtpEvZqo/giphy.gif) 
</div>

It is December 15, 1939 and Loew's Grand Theatre is shining as center stage for the premiere of American classic, [*Gone With The Wind*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind_(film)). Over the next few months, Scarlett and her beloved Rhett will sweep audiences off their feet, shatter attendance records, and garner reverent reviews from magazines and newspapers alike. Amongst the praise, however, are a few grumbles. Some reviewers felt the film was unnecessarily dragged out with repetitious scenes and mundane dialogue upping the minute count. Their claims were not unfounded: *Gone With The Wind clocked* in with a staggering 4-hour runtime, making it the longest American film of its day.  

Flash forward to the present, *Gone With The Wind* continues to hold a place amongst the [top 20 longest](http://www.amc.com/talk/2007/11/the-longest-ame-1) American movies ever made. Simultaneously, extended film lengths are again evoking similar ire amongst [millennial moviegoers](http://www.randalolson.com/2014/01/25/movies-arent-actually-much-longer-than-they-used-to-be/) who complain that movies are becoming longer than they used to be. But, have they really gotten longer since the days of black-and-white? Complaining millennials aside, do the rest of us really hate the extra film time?[^1]

As they [battle for profits](http://bgr.com/2015/01/02/netflix-vs-movie-theaters/) with entertainment competitors such as Netflix, production studios and other industry players have high stakes in understanding audience preferences. Luckily, the Internet gives us the means to address these questions with the runtimes and ratings within the [International Movie Database (IMDb)](http://www.imdb.com/). The data reveals not only film length patterns that reflect the history of entertainment technology, but also that we take a page from Rhett when it comes to enjoying long movies: frankly, we don’t give a damn.

The first task is demystifying the accusations around increasing movie length here in the U.S. In graphic above, the length of all the movies released in each year are averaged out and displayed against a time scale running from the glamourous 1920s to modern Hollywood. Besides the uptick around 1925 when the [Golden Age of Hollywood](http://www.filmsite.org/20sintro.html) popularized long feature films, average film length seems to have remained between 1.5 and 2 hours throughout the years. In other words, movie lengths haven’t been significantly extended over the decades.   

So do millennials lose this match point? Not quite. Though Graphic 1 shows average length staying within 1.5 to 2 hours, there are clearly ups-and-downs from decade to decade. When the [millennial generation](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/christine-henseler/millennials-and-boomers-generation-x_b_5253931.html) (born 1985-2000) was filling theater seats, runtime averages were indeed on the rise. From their perspective, they aren’t wrong in arguing that movies have gotten longer. Conversely, to you [Generation Xers](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/christine-henseler/millennials-and-boomers-generation-x_b_5253931.html) (born 1965-1985) insisting millennials whine too much, Graphic 1 provides a reminder that the victory of and adherence to 2-hour VHS tapes in the [videotape format war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotape_format_war) of the 70s slashed an average of 10 minutes off your childhood movies. There’s no clear winner here; we’re all justified.   

The period from 1930 to 1960 also exhibits an upward trend peaking around 1960 at 2 hours. The [rise of television](http://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/culture-magazines/hollywood-and-television-1950s-roots-diversification) in the 30s through 60s forced movie producers to compete by releasing epic films that extended runtimes by an average of around 30 minutes. Nowadays, TV and online streaming don’t appear to threaten movie studios as much as it used to. From 2000 onwards, runtimes stagnated at around 1.7 hours.  

Then are we really whining about long movies? Recall the last time you sat through a 3 hour movie - did you walk out complaining about having to pee or about how tedious the film was? Data shows that your hours of suffering waslikely worth it - longer films are actually rated higher.  

```{r fig.align="center"}
# Bin film length, find count and average rating
avg_rating_length <- ratelength %>% 
  mutate(Length = cut(ratelength$Length, 
                      breaks = c(-Inf, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, Inf), 
                      labels = c("1h+", "1.5h+", "2h+", "2.5h+", "3h+", "3.5h+"),
                      include.lowest = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(Length) %>% 
  summarize(num = n(), Rating = mean(Rating))
  
# Plot rating against length
# Size of diamond indicate number of films in the bin
avg_rating_length %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Length, y = Rating)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = num), shape = 18, 
             color = "royalblue4") + 
  geom_label(aes(label = num), nudge_y = .7) + 
  theme_wsj() + 
  scale_size(range = c(1,40)) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12), 
        plot.title = element_text(size = 15), 
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12)) +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Movie Length") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Average Rating", 
                     limits = c(5.5, 8.6), 
                     breaks = c(-Inf, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, Inf)) + 
  labs(title = "The Longer, The Better",
       subtitle = "The fewer longer movies are receiving higher ratings.")
```

This second graph above shows how average ratings of movies change as lengths increase, with diamond size indicating how many films are of that length. For example, there are 1421 movies that are between 2 and 2.5 hours; their average rating is around 7.0. Most movies run for 1.5 to 2 hours, and have a mediocre average rating around 6.4. So, takeaway for aspiring filmmakers: consider the long-run, literally.  

One possible explanation for this phenomenon stems from directors and their reputations for producing standout films. When a new director hits the scene, they have little credibility. Business-savvy production studios and investors are unlikely to trust newbies who haven’t proven their commercial appeal with extensive budgets. Without backing, longer movies are financially unattainable. Pulling in profits wins directors higher budgets, expansive resources, and creative freedom to produce longer movies. Whether those dollars are brought in by visionary talent or ability to capitalize on shock value, their presence indicates audience approval and higher ratings. Longer movies land higher ratings because only directors who have shown that they can attract audiences are trusted to produce them.   

Take Scorcese and Tarantino. Both are legends: Scorcese for hard-hitting films that defined his generation ([*Goodfellas*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099685/) anyone?) and Tarantino for trademark violence and profanity. Both are also producing longer films than before, fame raking in bigger budgets to work with. The third graphic below shows how Scorcese and Tarantino have edged away from average movie runtimes over the years as their films push closer to 2.5, almost 3 hours. Scorcese hasn’t directed a movie under 2 hours since his 1985 [*After Hours*](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/12/all-the-scorsese-movies-that-could-have-been-longer-than-wolf-of-wall-street/356335/); Tarantino has pushed closer to 3 hours since his 2015 [*The Hateful Eight*](https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Hateful-Eight-About-Three-Hours-Long-Too-Long-Or-Just-Right-93487.html). Yet, their increasing runtimes haven’t deterred them from scoring high ratings. In fact, moviegoers have consistently ranked their films in the range of 7 to 9, well above the average of 6.4 for movies that only run for 1.5 to 2 hours. For audiences, Scorcese and Tarantino’s delivery of quality entertainment seem to outweigh the 3-hour time commitment.

Alternatively, it could also be argued that only people who are already invested enough in the specific topic of a 3-hour long film are going to sit through it, and of course will rate it higher. Yet from the table below we can see that while some highly-rated long films are clearly niche, such as the adaptation of Tolstoy’s [*War and Peace*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049934/) or the detailed [*The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413615/), many of these movies receive large amounts of reviews, and are big names that we probably recognize from the "Must See" lists.

```{r fig.align="center"}
# Find information about films longer than 3h
genre_long <- ratelength %>% 
  filter(Length >= 180) 

# Show information of long films, sorted by rating
genre_long %>% 
  select(Rating, title, Year, Length, Votes, Director) %>% 
  filter(title != "Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair") %>% 
  rename('Film' = 'title') %>% 
  arrange(desc(Rating), desc(Votes)) %>% 
  kable(format = "html", align = 'c',
        caption = "Ratings of Movies Longer Than 3 Hours") %>% 
  kable_styling("striped") %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "440px")
```
  
So, long story short: Even if that next *Star Wars* franchise is 4 hours long, we’ll still be happily glued to our seats and devotedly chanting “May the Force Be With You” all the way through.
